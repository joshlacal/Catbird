- **VerificationReport**: Post-migration integrity verification
- **SafetyReport**: Pre-migration risk assessment

## Migration Workflow

### Phase 1: Pre-Migration Safety Checks
1. **Risk Assessment**: Comprehensive safety analysis
2. **Backup Creation**: Mandatory backup of current account
3. **Server Validation**: Compatibility checks between instances
4. **User Education**: Multiple warning stages and disclaimers

### Phase 2: Authentication
1. **Source Authentication**: Verify existing session
2. **Destination OAuth**: Secure authentication to target server
3. **Permission Validation**: Ensure necessary API access
4. **Rate Limit Verification**: Check migration feasibility

### Phase 3: Data Export
1. **Repository Export**: Download complete AT Protocol repository
2. **CAR File Generation**: Create Content Addressable Archive
3. **Integrity Validation**: Verify export completeness
4. **Temporary Storage**: Secure local storage during migration

### Phase 4: Data Import
1. **Repository Import**: Upload CAR file to destination
2. **Data Processing**: Server-side import and indexing
3. **Progress Monitoring**: Track import status
4. **Error Handling**: Retry logic and failure recovery

### Phase 5: Verification
1. **Data Integrity**: Compare source vs destination data
2. **Feature Verification**: Ensure functionality works
3. **Connection Validation**: Verify follows/blocks/mutes
4. **Completeness Check**: Sampling-based verification

### Phase 6: Completion
1. **Final Verification**: Last integrity checks
2. **Cleanup**: Remove temporary files
3. **History Recording**: Log migration for future reference
4. **User Notification**: Success/failure reporting

## Safety Measures

### Risk Assessment
- **Compatibility Analysis**: Server version and feature comparison
- **Data Size Validation**: Ensure destination can handle data volume
- **Rate Limit Checking**: Verify migration won't exceed limits
- **Server Stability**: Monitor source/destination health

### Real-Time Monitoring
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor each migration phase
- **Safety Alerts**: Detect and respond to issues
- **Emergency Stop**: User-controlled migration cancellation
- **Resource Monitoring**: Track system resources during migration

### Error Recovery
- **Checkpoint System**: Resume migration from interruption points
- **Rollback Capability**: Attempt to undo partial migrations
- **Backup Restoration**: Fallback to pre-migration state
- **Error Reporting**: Detailed failure analysis

## Integration Points

### AppState Integration
The migration service is integrated into AppState alongside other core services:
- Automatic client updates when authentication changes
- Service lifecycle management
- Cross-service coordination (backup, parsing, etc.)

### Navigation Integration
Migration flows are integrated into the app navigation system:
- **`.migrationWizard`**: Entry point from account settings
- **`.migrationProgress(UUID)`**: Live progress tracking
- Navigation handler provides appropriate views and titles

### Settings Integration
Migration entry point is added to Account Settings:
- Prominent experimental warning
- Risk disclaimers
- Integration with backup features

## Configuration Requirements

### AT Protocol Capabilities
- `com.atproto.sync.getRepo` - Repository export
- `com.atproto.repo.importRepo` - Repository import
- `com.atproto.server.describeServer` - Server capabilities
- OAuth 2.0 support for authentication

### Server Compatibility
- AT Protocol version 0.3.0 or higher
- Repository import/export support
- Adequate rate limits for data transfer
- Compatible feature set between source/destination

## Risk Factors & Limitations

### Critical Risks
1. **Data Loss**: Migration may fail catastrophically
2. **Account Corruption**: Partial migrations may leave accounts unusable
3. **Service Interruption**: Extended downtime during migration
