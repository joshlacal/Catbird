# 🚀 Next Steps - Start Here

**Current Status**: 85% Complete (22/26 tasks)  
**Documentation**: Clean and accurate ✅  
**Core Systems**: All working ✅

## What Just Happened

1. ✅ **Cleaned up stale documentation** - Archived 194 "unchecked" Post Composer TODOs that were actually completed in Oct 2025
2. ✅ **Created execution plans** - AGENTIC_EXECUTION_PLAN.md with detailed task specs
3. ⚠️ **Hit known issue** - Copilot CLI runner hangs (documented bug)

## What's Left (4 Tasks)

### 1. 🔴 **MOD-001: Post Hiding** (4-6 hours) - START HERE
High user value feature:
- Add hide/unhide to post menu
- Sync with Bluesky server
- Local fallback for offline
- See: AGENTIC_EXECUTION_PLAN.md Task 1

### 2. 🟡 **MSG-002: Messages Polish** (6-8 hours)
Fix state, scrolling, unread markers

### 3. 🟢 **UI-003: Liquid Glass Zoom** (3-4 hours)  
Add smooth 120-180ms transitions

### 4. 🔵 **TOOL-001: MCP Servers** (8-12 hours)
Developer tooling (optional)

**Plus 4 minor code TODOs** (4 hours)

## How to Proceed

### Option A: Start Manual Implementation 👈 RECOMMENDED

```bash
# 1. Review the plan
cat AGENTIC_EXECUTION_PLAN.md

# 2. Start with post hiding
# Design the feature, implement, test
# Follow Task 1 specs in AGENTIC_EXECUTION_PLAN.md
```

### Option B: Try Alternative Runner

```bash
# Use parallel-agents for independent execution
./parallel-agents.py quick \
  "Implement post hiding with Bluesky sync" \
  --approval '--allow-all-tools'
```

### Option C: Fix Copilot Runner

```bash
# Debug the hanging CLI issue
# See COPILOT_RUNNER_TROUBLESHOOTING.md
```

## Key Documents

📖 **Read These**:
- **EXECUTION_SUMMARY.md** - Complete status and options
- **AGENTIC_EXECUTION_PLAN.md** - Detailed task specifications
- **TODO.md** - Updated task list (85% done)
- **CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md** - What was cleaned and why

## Quick Validation

```bash
# Verify nothing is broken
./swift-check.sh

# Or just check specific files
swift -frontend -parse Catbird/Features/Feed/Views/FeedPostRow.swift
```

## 🎯 Bottom Line

**You're almost done!** 25-35 hours of work across 4 features to reach 100% completion. All core systems are production-ready. What remains are enhancements and polish.

**Start with**: MOD-001 Post Hiding (highest user value, well-specified in plan)
