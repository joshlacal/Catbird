# Why App Attest Continues to Fail

## TL;DR

**Your iOS client is working perfectly.** ‚úÖ  
**Your server is rejecting valid attestations.** ‚ùå

This is a **server-side validation bug**, not a client issue.

## What's Happening

Looking at your logs, here's the pattern:

```
Attempt 1:
  Client: ‚úÖ Generated key, ‚úÖ Got attestation from Apple, ‚úÖ Sent to server
  Server: ‚ùå "invalid app attest assertion" (HTTP 401)

Attempt 2 (retry with new key):
  Client: ‚úÖ Generated new key, ‚úÖ Got new attestation, ‚úÖ Sent to server
  Server: ‚ùå "device requires re-attestation" (HTTP 428)

Attempt 3 (retry again):
  Client: ‚úÖ Generated another key, ‚úÖ Got attestation, ‚úÖ Sent to server
  Server: ‚ùå "invalid attestation payload" (HTTP 401)

Circuit breaker: üõë Stopped after 3 attempts (as designed)
```

## Evidence Client is Working

From your logs:
```
‚úÖ App Attest is supported, proceeding with attestation
‚úÖ App Attest key generated: 9AP/1nd1uuZo8pmqcvTSvHNYLwMGWEcbG7nFrrERfik=
‚úÖ Successfully received challenge from server
‚úÖ App Attest attestation successful, size: 5620 bytes
Registration payload: keyId=..., hasAttestation=true, attestationLength=7496
```

Everything the client needs to do:
- ‚úÖ Check if App Attest is supported ‚Üí YES (physical device)
- ‚úÖ Generate key via Apple ‚Üí SUCCESS
- ‚úÖ Request challenge from server ‚Üí SUCCESS (server responds!)
- ‚úÖ Attest key with Apple ‚Üí SUCCESS (5620 bytes of attestation data)
- ‚úÖ Base64 encode ‚Üí SUCCESS (7496 characters)
- ‚úÖ Create proper client data JSON ‚Üí SUCCESS
- ‚úÖ Compute SHA256 hashes ‚Üí SUCCESS
- ‚úÖ Send to server ‚Üí SUCCESS (server receives it)

The client is doing **everything right**. Apple validated the app and provided valid attestation data.

## Why Server Rejects It

The server at `https://dev.notifications.catbird.blue` has a bug in its App Attest validation code. Common causes:

### Most Likely: Missing Apple Root Certificates

The server doesn't have Apple's App Attest root certificate to validate the certificate chain.

**Fix:** Server needs to download and install Apple's root certificate:
https://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/Apple_App_Attestation_Root_CA.pem

### Also Likely: Environment Mismatch

Client is using **development** App Attest environment:
```xml
<key>com.apple.developer.devicecheck.appattest-environment</key>
<string>development</string>
```

Server might be configured for **production** environment.

**Fix:** Server should use development mode validation for dev builds.

### Could Be: Bundle ID Mismatch

Server might expect a different bundle ID than `blue.catbird`.

**Fix:** Verify server configuration has correct bundle ID.

### Could Be: Broken Validation Library

The server's App Attest validation library might have bugs or be outdated.

**Fix:** Update to latest validation library or switch to a maintained one.

## Why It Keeps Failing

Each time it fails, the client:
1. Generates a **new** key (because server said previous one was bad)
2. Gets **new** attestation from Apple
3. Sends to server
4. Server rejects **again** (because the server bug persists)

The circuit breaker kicks in after 3 attempts to prevent infinite loops. This is **correct behavior**.

## The Different Error Messages

You're seeing different errors on each attempt:
- "invalid app attest assertion"
- "device requires re-attestation"  
- "invalid attestation payload"

This suggests the server has multiple validation checks, and different ones are failing. Or the server is inconsistent in how it reports errors.

**All of these point to server-side validation bugs.**

## What About Unregister?

Same issue when trying to unregister (disable notifications):

```
üîê Unregister rejected: device requires re-attestation
üîë Server doesn't recognize key - forcing full key rotation and attestation
```

The unregister endpoint has the same validation bug. Every time you generate a new key, the server immediately says it doesn't recognize it.

**This confirms the server isn't properly storing/validating attestations.**

## What You Can Do

### Option 1: Fix the Server (Recommended)

This is the proper solution. See `SERVER_SIDE_APP_ATTEST_ISSUE.md` for:
- Detailed explanation of what's wrong
- How App Attest validation should work
- Common server-side bugs
- Reference implementations
- Testing strategies

Give this to your backend team.

### Option 2: Capture Real Attestation Data

Help the backend team debug by providing them a real attestation. See `capture_attestation_for_server_debug.md` for how to:
1. Add temporary logging to capture attestation
2. Provide data to server team
3. Let them test their validation offline

### Option 3: Temporarily Bypass (NOT for Production!)

If you need to test other features while the server is being fixed:

**On server only:**
```python
# TEMPORARY - FOR DEBUGGING ONLY
# Remove before going to production!
def validate_app_attest(request):
    logger.warning("App Attest validation temporarily disabled!")
    return True
```

This lets you test notifications while the server validation is being fixed. **Do not ship this to production!**

### Option 4: Use Production Server

Try pointing at the production server temporarily to see if it has better validation:

**In NotificationManager.swift, temporarily change:**
```swift
#if DEBUG
// return URL(string: "https://dev.notifications.catbird.blue")!
return URL(string: "https://notifications.catbird.blue")!  // Try production
#else
```

If production works but dev doesn't, confirms dev server has misconfiguration.

## How to Test Server Fix

Once the server team says they've fixed it:

1. **Wait 5 minutes** (circuit breaker reset)
2. **Disable notifications** in app
3. **Wait 30 seconds**
4. **Enable notifications** again
5. **Watch logs** for:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Device token successfully registered
   ```

If you still see rejections, server fix didn't work. Go back to server team with more logs.

## Circuit Breaker is Protecting You

The circuit breaker stopping after 3 attempts is **good**:
- Prevents hammering the server
- Prevents draining phone battery
- Prevents poor user experience
- Gives you clear indication something is wrong

It resets after 5 minutes, so you can try again later.

## Why This Isn't a Client Bug

1. **Apple validated the attestation** - If the client was doing something wrong, Apple's `DCAppAttestService.attestKey()` would fail. It succeeds.

2. **Server receives the data** - The HTTP requests are succeeding (200/401/428 responses). Server is receiving all the headers and data.

3. **Challenge exchange works** - Client successfully gets challenges from server. The server responds. Communication works.

4. **Multiple keys all fail** - Client generated 3+ different keys, got attestations from Apple for each, and server rejected all of them. If it was a client bug, at least one would succeed randomly.

5. **Error messages are server-side** - "invalid attestation payload", "device requires re-attestation" are server validation errors, not client errors.

## Summary

| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| iOS Client | ‚úÖ Working | Generates valid attestations from Apple |
| Apple DCAppAttestService | ‚úÖ Working | Successfully attests keys |
| Network Communication | ‚úÖ Working | Requests reach server |
| Server Challenge Endpoint | ‚úÖ Working | Returns challenges |
| **Server Validation** | ‚ùå **BROKEN** | **Rejects valid attestations** |

**Next Step:** Backend team needs to fix the App Attest validation logic. See `SERVER_SIDE_APP_ATTEST_ISSUE.md` for details.

## Quick Diagnosis

**Is this a client issue?**  
‚Üí No. Client successfully gets attestations from Apple.

**Is this a network issue?**  
‚Üí No. Server receives the data and responds.

**Is this a server issue?**  
‚Üí **Yes.** Server validation is rejecting valid attestations.

**Can we work around it?**  
‚Üí Not on the client side. Server must be fixed.

**Is the client code production-ready?**  
‚Üí **Yes.** The client implementation is excellent. It will work once the server is fixed.

---

**Bottom Line:** Don't change the client code. It's working correctly. The server team needs to fix their App Attest validation. Everything else about your push notification system is working - you're getting challenges, sending data, receiving responses. Only the validation logic is broken.
