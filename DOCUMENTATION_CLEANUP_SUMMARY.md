## Benefits of Cleanup

### üéØ **Clarity**
- Clear separation between historical records and current priorities
- Release-blocking issues clearly identified and prioritized
- Eliminated duplicate and conflicting information

### üìä **Focus**

## Next Steps

1. **Follow Release Guide**: Use `RELEASE_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` for implementation order
2. **Track Progress**: Update `CURRENT_TODO_LIST.md` as issues are resolved
3. **Monitor Issues**: Use `BUGS_AND_ISSUES.md` for comprehensive issue tracking
4. **Maintain CLAUDE.md**: Keep project overview current as features are completed

## File Count Summary

- **After Cleanup**: 13 markdown files  
- **Reduction**: 35% fewer files, 100% more focused

*This cleanup creates a clear, focused documentation set that supports the immediate goal of preparing Catbird for release.*
