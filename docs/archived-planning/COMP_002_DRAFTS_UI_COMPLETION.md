# COMP-002: Post Composer Drafts UI Implementation

**Task ID**: COMP-002  
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Priority**: P1  
**Completion Date**: October 13, 2025

## Overview

Implemented complete draft functionality for the post composer, including auto-save, manual save, and draft restoration UI controls.

## What Was Added

### 1. Draft Save Option in Discard Dialog

When users try to cancel/close the composer with content, they now see three options:

- **Save Draft**: Saves the current content and dismisses the composer
- **Discard**: Permanently deletes the content
- **Keep Editing**: Returns to the composer (cancel)

**Location**: `PostComposerViewUIKit.swift` lines 321-337

```swift
.confirmationDialog(
    "Discard post?",
    isPresented: $showingDismissAlert,
    titleVisibility: .visible
) {
    Button("Save Draft") {
        let draft = viewModel.saveDraftState()
        appState.composerDraftManager.storeDraft(draft)
        dismissReason = .discard
        dismiss()
    }
    Button("Discard", role: .destructive) {
        dismissReason = .discard
        appState.composerDraftManager.clearDraft()
        dismiss()
    }
    Button("Keep Editing", role: .cancel) { }
}
```

### 2. Draft Restore Button in Toolbar

When a saved draft exists, a "Draft" button appears in the top-left toolbar (`.topBarLeading` placement):

- Shows an icon (`doc.text`) and "Draft" label
- Tapping restores the saved draft content into the current composer
- Only visible when `appState.composerDraftManager.currentDraft != nil`

**Location**: `PostComposerViewUIKit.swift` lines 340-355

```swift
ToolbarItem(placement: .topBarLeading) {
    if appState.composerDraftManager.currentDraft != nil {
        Button(action: {
            if let draft = appState.composerDraftManager.currentDraft {
                viewModel.restoreDraftState(draft)
            }
        }) {
            HStack(spacing: 4) {
                Image(systemName: "doc.text")
                Text("Draft")
                    .appFont(.caption)
            }
            .foregroundColor(.accentColor)
        }
        .accessibilityLabel("Restore draft")
    }
}
```

## Existing Auto-Save Functionality (Previously Implemented)

The following auto-save features were already working:

1. **Auto-save timer**: Saves draft every 5 seconds while composing
2. **Auto-save on changes**: Saves when text or media changes
3. **Cleanup on deinit**: Timer cleanup when composer is dismissed
4. **Persistence**: Drafts saved to `UserDefaults` and restored on app launch

**Location**: `PostComposerViewModel.swift`

## User Experience Flow

### Scenario 1: User Saves Draft Manually
1. User starts composing a post
2. User taps Cancel (X button)
3. Dialog appears: "Discard post?"
4. User taps **"Save Draft"**
5. Content is saved, composer dismisses
6. Next time composer opens, "Draft" button appears in toolbar
7. User taps "Draft" to restore content

### Scenario 2: Auto-Save While Composing
1. User types for more than 5 seconds
2. Draft automatically saves in background
3. If app crashes or user navigates away, draft persists
4. On next composer open, "Draft" button visible
5. User can restore the auto-saved content

### Scenario 3: User Discards Content
1. User starts composing
2. User taps Cancel (X)
3. Dialog appears
4. User taps **"Discard"** (destructive action)
5. Draft is permanently deleted
6. Composer dismisses with no saved content

## Technical Details

### Draft Storage
- **Manager**: `ComposerDraftManager` in `Core/Services/`
- **Storage**: `UserDefaults` with key `"composerMinimizedDraft"`
- **Format**: Codable `PostComposerDraft` struct
- **Includes**: Text, media items, video, GIFs, languages, thread entries

### State Management
- Draft state managed by `@Observable AppState.composerDraftManager`
- Reactive UI updates when draft changes
- Thread-safe access to draft data

### Accessibility
- Cancel button: "Cancel" accessibility label
- Draft restore button: "Restore draft" accessibility label
- Post button: Dynamic label based on context (Reply/Post)

## Files Modified

1. **PostComposerViewUIKit.swift**
   - Added "Save Draft" option to discard confirmation dialog
   - Added draft restore button in toolbar (`.topBarLeading`)
   - Updated dialog flow to include three options

2. **TODO.md**
   - Updated COMP-002 task status to include UI completion
   - Added note about UI controls

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Draft save button appears in discard dialog
- [x] "Save Draft" saves content and dismisses
- [x] "Draft" button appears when draft exists
- [x] Tapping "Draft" restores saved content
- [x] "Discard" permanently deletes draft

## Related Tasks

- **COMP-001**: Share-to importer crash fix (dependency - ✅ complete)
- **UI-001**: Muted words toast fix (✅ complete)
- **FEED-001**: Reply flood suppression (✅ complete)

## Next Steps

With COMP-002 now complete, the composer system is fully functional with:
- ✅ Auto-save (5s interval)
- ✅ Manual save via dialog
- ✅ Draft restoration UI
- ✅ Draft persistence
- ✅ Proper cleanup

**P1 Composer Tasks**: 2/2 complete (100%)

## Notes

- Uses SwiftUI's `.confirmationDialog()` for native iOS/macOS appearance
- `.topBarLeading` placement ensures draft button doesn't conflict with post button
- Leverages existing `ComposerDraftManager` infrastructure
- No breaking changes to existing auto-save functionality
