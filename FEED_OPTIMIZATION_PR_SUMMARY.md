# Feed Performance Optimization - PR Summary

## Agent 2: Feed Performance Specialist

### Branch: feature/feed-optimization

## Overview
Comprehensive feed performance optimizations focusing on thread consolidation, intelligent prefetching, and improved user experience for smooth scrolling with 1000+ posts.

## Changes Made

### 1. FeedTuner Algorithm Optimization
- **File**: `Catbird/Features/Feed/Services/FeedTuner.swift`
- Implemented root URI grouping for efficient thread consolidation
- Reduced complexity from O(n²) to O(n log n)
- Optimized deduplication with batch operations and reduced allocations

### 2. Intelligent Content Prefetching
- **File**: `Catbird/Features/Feed/Services/FeedPrefetchingManager.swift`
- Added priority-based prefetching system
- Implemented viewport-aware prefetching for visible/upcoming posts
- Added asset deduplication to prevent redundant network requests
- Configured automatic cache eviction for memory management

### 3. PostHeightCalculator Enhancements
- **File**: `Catbird/Core/Utilities/PostHeightCalculator.swift`
- Added separate text size cache for expensive calculations
- Implemented batch height calculation for multiple posts
- Configured memory limits (1000 entries, 1MB for heights, 500 entries for text)

### 4. Infinite Scroll Performance
- **File**: `Catbird/Features/Feed/Views/Components/LoadMoreTrigger.swift`
- Added debouncing (200ms) to prevent rapid-fire triggers
- Implemented loading state management
- Added proper task cancellation on view disappear

### 5. Pull-to-Refresh UX Improvements
- **File**: `Catbird/Features/Feed/Views/FeedContentView.swift`
- Added haptic feedback (light impact on start, success notification on complete)
- Improved animation timing with 100ms delay
- Enhanced state management with feedback timers

## Performance Metrics

### Before Optimization
- Thread consolidation: O(n²) complexity
- Height calculations: No caching, repeated calculations
- Prefetching: Basic, no deduplication
- Scroll triggers: Could fire multiple times rapidly

### After Optimization
- Thread consolidation: O(n log n) complexity
- Height calculations: Dual-cache system with memory limits
- Prefetching: Priority-based with viewport awareness
- Scroll triggers: Debounced with state management

## Testing Results
- Smooth scrolling with 1000+ posts
- Reduced memory footprint with automatic cache eviction
- No duplicate API calls during rapid scrolling
- Improved perceived performance with haptic feedback
