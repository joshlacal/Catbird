## ðŸš€ Agent Workflow Instructions

### **Phase 1: Environment Setup (5 minutes)**
1. **Navigate to assigned worktree:** `cd [your-worktree-path]`
2. **Verify branch:** `git branch` (should show `feature/[your-feature]`)
3. **Check project status:** `git status` (should be clean)
4. **Read task config:** Review your JSON task file for detailed requirements

### **Phase 2: Analysis & Planning (15 minutes)**
1. **Examine current implementation** in your key files
2. **Identify technical debt** and areas for improvement
3. **Create implementation plan** with specific milestones
4. **Document current state** and planned changes

### **Phase 3: Implementation (90-120 minutes)**
1. **Implement core requirements** from your task specification
2. **Make incremental commits** with descriptive messages
3. **Test changes** using iOS simulator
4. **Document any issues** or blockers encountered

### **Phase 4: Testing & Validation (20 minutes)**
1. **Build and run** on iPhone 16 Pro simulator
2. **Test all implemented features** thoroughly
3. **Take screenshots** showing functionality works
4. **Verify no regressions** in other app areas

### **Phase 5: Documentation & Handoff (10 minutes)**

## ðŸ“Š Coordination & Progress Tracking

### **Git Workflow:**
- **Branch Naming:** `feature/[feature-name]` (already created)
- **Commit Format:** `feat(scope): description` following conventional commits
- **Push Frequency:** After each major milestone completion
- **Merge Strategy:** Feature branches will be merged to main after testing

### **Communication Protocol:**
- **Status Updates:** Commit messages serve as progress indicators

## ðŸš¨ Critical Reminders

1. **Work in your assigned worktree only** - avoid conflicts with other agents
2. **Test thoroughly on iOS simulator** before marking features complete
3. **Follow SwiftUI best practices** and maintain code quality
4. **Document any architectural decisions** or significant changes
5. **Report blockers early** if you encounter insurmountable issues
6. **Maintain backward compatibility** with existing features
