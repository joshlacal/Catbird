# Direct Execution Status - Agentic Tasks

**Date**: October 14, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Complete - MOD-001 & MSG-002 (Partial) Implemented  
**Overall Completion**: 92% (24/26 tasks)  
**Remaining**: 2 P2 tasks

## Execution Approach

Using direct tool execution and MCP servers instead of copilot-runner:
- ✅ Sequential-thinking for planning
- ✅ MCP tools for building/testing  
- ✅ Direct file editing for implementation
- ✅ Syntax validation after changes

## Task Execution Order

### Phase 1: High-Priority Tasks (Current)

#### Task 1: MOD-001 - Post Hiding Implementation
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Implementation**:
- Created PostHidingManager with server sync (HiddenPostsPref) and local storage
- Integrated into AppState with client lifecycle management
- Added hiddenPosts to FeedTunerSettings
- Updated ContentFilterService to filter hidden posts
- Added hide/unhide UI to post menu
- Added sync call on auth completion

**Files created/modified**:
- `Catbird/Features/Moderation/Services/PostHidingManager.swift` (created)
- `Catbird/Core/State/AppState.swift` (updated)
- `Catbird/Features/Feed/Services/FeedTuner.swift` (updated)
- `Catbird/Features/Feed/Services/ContentFilterService.swift` (updated)
- `Catbird/Features/Feed/Models/FeedModel.swift` (updated)
- `Catbird/Features/Feed/Views/PostContextMenuViewModel.swift` (updated)
- `Catbird/Features/Feed/Views/PostView.swift` (updated)

**Documentation**: `MOD_001_POST_HIDING_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

#### Task 2: MSG-002 - Messages Polish
**Status**: ✅ Complete (Partial - Core Optimization)  
**Implementation**:
- Implemented batch profile fetching using `getProfiles` API
- Reduces API calls by 80%+ (N individual calls → batched calls of 25)
- Prefetches all conversation member profiles on load
- Maintains existing cache with better initial population

**Analysis**:
- Documented current state (state management, unread tracking already solid)
- Identified iOS-only constraints (ExyteChat dependency)
- Created testing/profiling guide for future improvements

**Deferred** (Requires iOS testing):
- Unread message markers in UI
- Scrolling performance optimization (needs Instruments profiling)
- Read receipt visual indicators

**Files modified**:
- `Catbird/Features/Chat/Services/ChatManager.swift` (added batch functions)

**Documentation**: `MSG_002_MESSAGES_POLISH_ANALYSIS.md`
