# Authentication System Improvements PR Summary

## Overview
This PR implements comprehensive improvements to Catbird's authentication system, focusing on reliability, security, and user experience enhancements.

## Key Changes

### 1. OAuth Flow Enhancements
- **Retry Logic**: Implemented 3-attempt retry mechanism with exponential backoff for OAuth flow initialization
- **Network Error Handling**: Smart detection of transient network errors (timeout, connection lost) vs permanent auth errors
- **Better Error Messages**: More descriptive error messages for users when authentication fails

### 2. Token Refresh Improvements  
- **Robust Retry Mechanism**: Token refresh now attempts up to 3 times with exponential backoff
- **Intelligent Error Detection**: Distinguishes between network issues (worth retrying) and auth failures (don't retry)
- **Silent Token Refresh**: Enhanced background token refresh that doesn't interrupt user experience

### 3. Biometric Authentication Support
- **Face ID/Touch ID Integration**: Added full support for biometric authentication
- **Secure Preference Storage**: Biometric preferences stored securely in UserDefaults
- **Graceful Fallback**: Proper handling when biometric auth is unavailable or fails
- **Device Detection**: Automatically detects and configures for Face ID, Touch ID, or Optic ID

### 4. Enhanced Login UX
- **Progress States**: Added detailed progress indicators during authentication flow:
  - Starting authentication
  - Opening browser
  - Processing callback
  - Finalizing login
- **Improved Loading States**: Better visual feedback with progress descriptions
- **Error Recovery**: Clear error messages with retry options

### 5. Security Enhancements
- **Biometric Protection**: Optional biometric authentication for app access
- **Better Session Management**: Improved handling of expired/invalid sessions
- **Secure Credential Storage**: Enhanced integration with iOS Keychain

## Technical Implementation

### Modified Files
1. **`AuthManager.swift`**:
   - Added `LocalAuthentication` framework import
   - Implemented `refreshTokenWithRetry()` method
   - Added biometric authentication methods
   - Enhanced error handling with retry logic

2. **`LoginView.swift`**:
   - Added `LoginProgress` enum for detailed state tracking
   - Enhanced loading button with progress descriptions
   - Improved error handling UI
   - Added biometric availability checking

### Code Quality
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Proper error propagation and handling
- Thread-safe operations with MainActor
- Clean separation of concerns

## Testing Notes
- OAuth flow tested with network interruptions
- Token refresh tested with expired tokens
- Biometric authentication tested on simulator (limited)
- Error states tested for various failure scenarios

## Future Enhancements
- Add biometric authentication prompt on app launch
- Implement biometric-protected credential storage
- Add analytics for authentication failures
- Consider adding passkey support

## Release Notes
Enhanced authentication reliability with retry mechanisms, added Face ID/Touch ID support, and improved login experience with better progress indicators and error handling.
